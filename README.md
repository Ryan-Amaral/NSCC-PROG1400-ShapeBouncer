A project for an Intro to Object Oriented Programming class at NSCC. This program features multiple shapes bouncing around the screen. A shape can be added by clicking on the screen. Once the shape is added it is given a random velocity in the x and y direction. When it hits another shape, the two shapes swap their velocities. When a shape hits an edge, it reverses the velocity on the axis that touches the edge. To make it a bit more interesting I added some health to the shapes, so they decay with each collision with another shape. The shapes start out as plaid, after a few hits they bocome solid or a gradient color, after some more hits they become just an outline, then after some more hits they disappear altogether.
